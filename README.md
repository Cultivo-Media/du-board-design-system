A design system specifically created for handling elements for DU boards (job boards, student boards, etc). This repository originally was not going to be created, however a need arrose when multiple projects were going to be created all utilizing the same styles built within each.

The goal of this repository is to provide style-focused components to be used in various applications, mainly the applications being built for DU and Project X-ITE.
